Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I'd love your help testing **Solacore**, a new AI-powered problem-solving app I've been working on.

## What is Solacore?

Solacore is a mobile app that acts as your thinking partner when you're stuck on a decision or facing a challenge. It guides you through a structured 5-step framework:

1. **Receive**: Describe your problem or challenge
2. **Clarify**: Unpack the situation with AI-powered questions
3. **Reframe**: See your challenge from new perspectives
4. **Options**: Explore solutions with AI suggestions
5. **Commit**: Choose a next action and move forward

The app integrates with OpenAI and Claude to provide intelligent, context-aware guidance while keeping conversations private and secure.

## Why I Need Your Help

As a beta tester, you'll help me:

1. **Validate the core value proposition**: Does this actually help people think better?
2. **Identify usability issues**: Where do people get confused or stuck?
3. **Find bugs**: What breaks? What's slow? What's frustrating?
4. **Prioritize features**: What's missing? What would make this 10x better?

Your honest, critical feedback is **much more valuable** than politeness. If something sucks, please tell me! 😅

Hi [Name],

Thanks for installing Solacore! 🎉

I noticed you haven't submitted feedback yet - no rush, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts when you get a chance.

**A few quick questions:**
1. Did you try the 5-step problem-solving flow?
2. Was anything confusing or frustrating?

- Structured form: [Attach beta-feedback-form.md]
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/412984588/solacore/issues/new/choose

Even a 2-sentence reply like "It's cool but X was annoying" is super helpful. 🙏

If you haven't had time to try it yet, that's totally fine - just let me know and I'll follow up later.

Thanks for being a tester!

### Template 6: Thank You + Feedback Request

**Use When:** Tester has been active but you want to request more detailed feedback

**Subject:** `Thank you + a few quick questions 🙏`

**Message:**

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to say **thank you** for testing Solacore and reporting [bug/issue] last week! Your feedback has already helped improve the app for everyone.

Since you've been using the app, I'd love to dig a bit deeper into your experience:

**A few questions (feel free to answer any/all):**

1. **Value**: Did using Solacore actually help you think through your problem? Or did it feel like just another chatbot?

2. **Friction points**: What almost made you give up or close the app?

3. **Missing features**: What would make you use this daily instead of just once?

4. **Competitors**: How does this compare to ChatGPT, journaling, or talking to a friend?

5. **Willingness to pay**: If this were $5/month, would you pay for it? Why or why not?

No need to write an essay - even bullet points are super helpful!

**Reply here or use the feedback form**: [Attach beta-feedback-form.md]

Thanks again for being an awesome tester! 🙏

[Your Name]
```

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- `[Name]` → Tester's name
- `[bug/issue]` → Specific contribution
- `[Your Name]` → Your name

## Do & Don't (Sending Best Practices)

### ✅ DO

- **Personalize each message**: Add a line about why you chose this person ("I know you're good at X, so I'd love your perspective")
- **Test the APK link first**: Download and install yourself before sending to others
- **Update the build date**: If you send a new build, mention "New build from Dec 24 with bug fixes"
- **Set expectations clearly**: "This is rough beta software - expect bugs"
- **Make it easy to say no**: "If you're too busy, no problem at all!"
- **Follow up politely**: 1 reminder after 3 days, 1 after 7 days, then stop
- **Thank every tester**: Even if they only tested for 5 minutes
- **Share updates**: When you fix their reported bugs, let them know!

### ❌ DON'T

- **Spam the same message to 50 people**: Personalize at least the first line
- **Send broken links**: Always test before sending
- **Overpromise**: Don't say "This will change your life" - set realistic expectations
- **Guilt trip**: Don't say "I spent months on this, please test it"
- **Ask for feedback too soon**: Give testers 3-5 days to try the app first
- **Send without context**: Don't just send an APK link with no explanation
- **Ignore feedback**: If someone reports a bug, acknowledge it within 24 hours
- **Forget to remove inactive testers**: After 2 reminders, stop bothering them
